# *Telecom ETL Using SSIS*

This ETL solution leverages SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to extract transaction data from flat files, transform and clean the data, and load it into a SQL Server database. This setup is specifically designed to handle telecom transaction data, process errors, and perform audits.

## *Overview*
The solution extracts data from flat files (CSV format), processes both valid and invalid records, and loads them into corresponding database tables. The ETL process has several components:

1. Fact Transaction Table - Stores valid records.
2. Error Tables - Stores invalid records for troubleshooting.
3. Dimension Table - Contains reference information to enrich transactions.

This setup includes looping through multiple files, validating data types, checking for null values, and error handling.

## *Database Tables*

### 1. Fact_Transaction Table
* This table stores valid transactions that meet the schema requirements.
* Each record comes from a source flat file and is transformed if needed before insertion.

### 2. Err_Destination_Output Table
* This table stores transactions that have errors in the Fact_Transaction table, such as null values in critical fields.

### 3. Dim_IMSI_Reference Table
* This dimension table includes ```subscriber_id``` reference data, used to enrich transactions in ```Fact_Transaction```.
* Helps check whether a ```subscriber_id``` is null.
* Contains logic to derive values for ```TAC``` and ```SNR``` fields based on the imsi column.

###  4. Err_Source_Output Table
* Stores records from the source flat files that have incorrect data types or are incompatible with the Fact_Transaction table structure.

## *Variables*
### File Handling Variables
```ff_src_file_name``` - Stores the name of the current source file.
```ff_src_folder_path``` - Defines the folder path containing source files.
```ff_src_file_extension``` - Specifies the file extension (e.g., ```.csv```).
```ff_src_full_path``` - The full path combining folder and filename for the source file.
#### Archive Variables
```ff_dest_archive``` - Destination folder path for moving or copying processed files.
```move_copy``` - Defines whether the file should be copied or moved after processing.
### Auditing Variables
```audit_id``` - Unique identifier for each row in the database during loading.
```batch_id``` - Stores the maximum batch_id + 1 from dim_audit table, representing each new file batch.
```rc_extracted_processed``` - Row count of records extracted and processed.
```rc_extracted_error``` - Row count of records with errors.
```rc_dest_error``` - Row count of error rows in src_destination_output.
```rc_pre_insert``` - Row count of valid records ready for insertion into fact_transaction.

## *SSIS Package Workflow*
1.ForEach Loop Container

* Iterates through all files in the specified source folder.
* For each file, data is extracted, transformed, validated, and then loaded into appropriate tables.
2.File Processing

* Validates each recordâ€™s data type and field requirements before loading into Fact_Transaction.
* Moves invalid records to either Err_Destination_Output or Err_Source_Output.
3. Data Transformation

* Uses the imsi column to derive TAC (first 8 characters) and SNR (next 6 characters) before loading data.
4. File Archiving

* Based on the move_copy variable, processed files are either moved or copied from the source folder to the destination archive folder.

<br><br/>

## *Auditing*
Each file processing run includes an audit process to track and log various stages of the ETL:

* ```audit_id``` logs each row of data loaded.
* ```batch_id``` helps identify individual file batches and increments with each new file.
* Row count variables (```rc_extracted_processed```, ```rc_extracted_error```, ```rc_dest_error```, ```rc_pre_insert```) track records at different stages of ETL to monitor and ensure data quality.

<br><br/>

## *Usage*
1. Place source flat files in the specified ```ff_src_folder_path```.
2. Set SSIS variable values, such as ```ff_dest_archive``` and ```move_copy```.
3. Execute the SSIS package to start the ETL process. Processed files will be moved or copied based on the ```move_copy``` variable.
4. Review the logs in ```dim_audit``` table to verify counts and ensure data accuracy.
